# NodeJS CMD
This project is a forever going project that gathers utilities from my daily activities. It is meant to run on terminal.

## Setup

1. Clone repository
1. `yarn install`
1. `yarn dev`

## Build
When building a folder `dist` will be created in the root of the project.

Run:
`yarn tsc`

Now you can CD to the dist folder and run:

`node .`
